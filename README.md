# 12th Man Automation - Code folder

Here is a folder for all of the code that we have on this project, along with any test files that we are using at the moment to make the code run.
The folder is split into 4 main sections

## 1. Raw data 
This is the processed and raw data runs from the Pilot Plant - essentially the training set of data which is used to train the plant
A readme containing the information about each of the runs, such as plant configurations and further intel is provided

## 2. Data loading and P&ID processing 
This section contains code and Excel Macros which we use to process the data that comes directly from the pilot plant
It also has preliminary code that we are utilising in order to automate the plant P&ID

## 3. Anomaly detector
This section contains code and Excel Macros which we use for anomaly detection, including any regressions and statistics that were used for this code
It also has preliminary code that we are utilising in order to create a simulator for parts of the process

## 4. Alarm matcher and operator advisor
This section contains code and Excel Macros which we use for alarm matching and for problem detection.
This covers the anomaly matching and SOP automation sections of the process
